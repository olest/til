Pressure Stalling Information (PSI)

The Linux Pressure Stalling Information (PSI) gathers information on resource saturation.
It collects metrics for three major resources - memory, CPU, and IO.

These metrics do not only show that there is saturation at the moment, but also changes over time.

Pressure information for each resource can be accessed via files in /proc/pressure/.

PSI is included in Linux kernel versions 4.20 and later.
