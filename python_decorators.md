What are decorators in python?

A python decorator wraps a function and modifies its behaviour.

Decorators can be used for debugging or to collect timing information. The module `decorators`
already contains some examples.

Python has also built-in decorators to modify the behaviour of functions inside a class.

This link shows a nice example of a plugin architecture implemented with a decorator
