## updating cargo and rustc

Both `cargo` and `rustc` should be updated based on the way they were installed. If you used rustup,
a `rustup update` should be enough. Otherwise one should consult the package manager used for installation.

Even if `rustc` and `cargo` are shipped together, but that doesn't mean that their versions need to match.
